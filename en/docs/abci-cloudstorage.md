# ABCI Cloud Storage

ABCI Cloud Storage Service offers an object storage service that has a compatible interface with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

ABCI Cloud Storage has unique capabilities.

- Compatibility

    Users store data into a globally unique bucket through the interface compatible with Amazon S3. Clients compatible with S3 such as AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and s3cmd are available. Users can also make client tools by using boto. Some APIs are not supported. The example of usage of AWS CLI is shown in another section.
    
- Accessibility

    Users can access the storage not only from the computational nodes or interactive nodes but also from outside ABCI. In other words, ABCI users can use the storage as a data transferring tool that allows users to transfer data for computational jobs from outside ABCI.

- Encryptability

    Users can encrypt data transfers between clients and the storage. Users can also encrypt data and store encrypted data in the storage.

To start using ABCI Cloud Storage, Usage Manager of each ABCI group should apply for use on [ABCI User Portal](https://portal.abci.ai/user/).
If you are not a Usage Manager, please contact to Usage Managers of your group.
For details of the operation, refer to [ABCI Portal Guide](https://docs.abci.ai/portal/en/).

ABCI points based on the total size of objects in buckets owned by your ABCI group are subtracted from your ABCI group's each day. There is no charge for data transfer or API calls. Users can check the total size by [show_cs_usage](getting-started.md#check-cloud-storage-usage). The calculation formula of ABCI points for using ABCI Cloud Storage is as follows.

```
ABCI point = the size of data stored in the storage of the previous day
           Ã— charge coefficient of ABCI Cloud Storage
```

As for charge coefficient of ABCI Cloud Storage, see [this page](https://abci.ai/en/how_to_use/tariffs.html).
