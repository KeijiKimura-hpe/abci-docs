# README

The primary goal of this project is to organize a concerted community effort to improve the ABCI User Guide and Portal Guide that explain how to utilize [AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure (ABCI)](https://abci.ai/).
ABCI is the world's first large-scale Open AI Computing Infrastructure, constructed and operated by [National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)](https://www.aist.go.jp/).
We would welcome your feedbacks including pull requests.

On every *release* we will deploy it as the current *official* versions of the ABCI User Guide and Portal Guide, which are located at [https://docs.abci.ai/](https://docs.abci.ai/).
